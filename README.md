# EmployeeDirectory
A modular React based employee directory.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

=============================================================

I wanted to have a litte fun with this application and so I replaced the typical employee template with super heroes from the Marvel universe.

The application itself is fairly straight forward. It sets up a JSon list of heroes by first and last name and maps that information onto the application.

The user can order the heroes in alphabetical order by first name using the Alphabetize Heroes button function.

The user can also search for a specific hero by entering the character's first or last name.
